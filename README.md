## Abstract / Purpose
Purpose: To find the effects of external temperature on the increase of (male) body temperature during exercise. 

## Methods
**Participants:** 15 male participants, ages 18-23, at a military college. 
* **Procedure:** Participants used an Ergomedic stationary bicycle (model 828 E) for 20 minutes. 
* **Groups/Temperatures:** * Group 1 (Control): 70 degrees Fahrenheit 
    * Group 2: 75 degrees Fahrenheit 
    * Group 3: 60 degrees Fahrenheit 
* **Measurements:** Body temperature was recorded before, midway, and after exercising using a Raytek MiniTEMP MT6 digital temperature probe. 

## Key Results
* **Statistical Finding:** There was no significant effect of external body heat on internal body heat during exercise at the $p<.05$ level across any period (pre, mid, or post-exercise). 
* **Conclusion:** The largest temperature increase was found in temperatures around 70 degrees Fahrenheit, which disproved the hypothesis that the largest increase would be found in the cooler 60 degrees Fahrenheit group.
