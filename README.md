## Abstract / Purpose
[Summarize the purpose and overall findings. [cite_start]Purpose: To find the effects of external temperature on the increase of (male) body temperature during exercise. [cite: 11]]

## Methods
* [cite_start]**Participants:** 15 male participants, ages 18-23, at a military college. [cite: 12]
* [cite_start]**Procedure:** Participants used an Ergomedic stationary bicycle (model 828 E) for 20 minutes. [cite: 13]
* [cite_start]**Groups/Temperatures:** * Group 1 (Control): 70 degrees Fahrenheit [cite: 32]
    * [cite_start]Group 2: 75 degrees Fahrenheit [cite: 35]
    * [cite_start]Group 3: 60 degrees Fahrenheit [cite: 37]
* [cite_start]**Measurements:** Body temperature was recorded before, midway, and after exercising using a Raytek MiniTEMP MT6 digital temperature probe. [cite: 13, 15, 40]

## Key Results
* [cite_start]**Statistical Finding:** There was no significant effect of external body heat on internal body heat during exercise at the $p<.05$ level across any period (pre, mid, or post-exercise). [cite: 56]
* [cite_start]**Conclusion:** The largest temperature increase was found in temperatures around 70 degrees Fahrenheit, which disproved the hypothesis that the largest increase would be found in the cooler 60 degrees Fahrenheit group. [cite: 67, 68]
